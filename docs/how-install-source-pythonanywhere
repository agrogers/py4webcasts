# NOT FULLY TESTED: How to install from source on PythonAnywhere

## TODO:
* Is this specific enough? 
  + * Choose **Python 3.8** or **Python 3.7**.

## Download Git

This tutorial requires that you have the [Git] command-line utility

* Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

It helps but isn't required that you follow its excellent tutorial.

## Create a free account on PythonAnywhere

PythonAnywhere generously allows you to create a full working account for free, allowing you to create py4web apps.
You don't need a credit card to create the free account.

* Visit [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/pricing/) and choose **Create a Beginner Account**

* Enter your desired login information on the [Create Your Account](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/) page.

* Check the terms and conditions box and choose **Register**.

You're given brief online tour of PythonAnywhere.

* Choose **End Tour** when you're done.

## Go to the PythonAnywhere dashboard

Let's make sure we're on the same page, which should the the dashboard.

* Choose the [PythonAnywhere logo](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) at the top of the page to navigate to the PythonAnywhere dashboard.

You'll see a navigation menu near the top of the page that says **Dashboard  Consoles  Files  Web  Tasks  Databases**.

## Go to the WebApps page and create a new web app

On the navigation bar near the top of the page that says **Dashboard  Consoles  Files  Web  Tasks  Databases** choose **Web**

* Choose **Add a new web app**.

* A dialog appears called  **Create a new web app**

You're informed that PythonAnywhere is creating a URL for your site and displays that URL.

* Choose **Next**.

### Choose the Flask framework

The **Select a Python Web framework**  dialog appears, showing a list of frameworks like web2py, Django, Flask, and so on.

Currently there's no built-in support for py4web, but py4web is based partly on Flask. So:

* Choose **Flask** from the list.

You're asked to select a Python version.

* Choose **Python 3.8** or **Python 3.7**.

The **Quickstart new Flask Project** dialog appears. You're asked to give the location where a `flask_app.py` file will be generated. 
It looks something like this, where `XXX` would be the account name you created on signup. You'll need to change it.

**Path**  

```bash
/home/XXX/mysite/flask_app.py
```

* Replace the `mysite` portion with `py4web`. The whole thing would look like this, where `XXX` is used in place of your account name. For example:

```bash
/home/XXX/py4web/flask_app.py
```

* Choose **Next**.

### Reload your web app

You're returned to the **Web** page

There is now a **Configuration** section with the name of your URL, and a big green **Reload** button with your URL on it.

* Choose the **Reload XXX.pythonanywhere.com** button, where XXX is used in place of your account name.

A wait icon appears for a few seconds, then the page returns to its previous state. You're finally ready to install py4web.

## Installing py4web from source on pythonanywhere

One of the distinct features of py4web is that it is nothing more than a Python program. py4web apps are nothing more than a simple
directory tree structure with a few files inside an applications subdirectory. This section shows how to clone the py4web repo
from GitHub. It uses the Bash command line console supplied with PythonAnywhere.

* From the **Dashboard  Consoles  Files  Web  Tasks  Databases** navigation menu choose **Consoles**.

After a few seconds, the Bash prompt appears. It's pretty much just a `$` sign.

* Enter `git clone https://github.com/web2py/py4web.git` at the prompt:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/web2py/py4web.git
```
