# How to uninstall PyDAL

Some problems have been reported updating PyDAL without removing earlier versions--possibly more than once.
Here's how to uninstall PyDAL, and how to install a particular version.

## To uninstall earlier versions of PyDAL

Suppose you want the newest version of PyDAL and wish to avoid version conflicts. 
Depending on how long you've been using it, you may need to uninstall earlier versions explicitly

The commands to uninstall specified versions look like this (obviously the versions you used may differ):

```
:: Windows users can omit the sudo
sudo python3.6 -m pip uninstall pydal
sudo python3.7 -m pip uninstall pydal
sudo python3.8 -m pip uninstall pydal
```

You may need to do this twice. Unlike Python 2.x, Python3 appears not to get this right every time.

## To install PyDAL for a particular version of Python

Then to install a particular version of PyDAL, for example the one for Python 3.8, use `pip` as expected:

```
python3.8 -m pip install -U pydal
```
