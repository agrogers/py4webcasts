# Creating a free account on PythonAnywhere

PythonAnywhere generously allows you to create a full working account for free, allowing you to create py4web apps.
You don't need a credit card to create the free account.

* Visit [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/pricing/) and choose **Create a Beginner Account**

* Enter your desired login information on the [Create Your Account](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/) page.

If you're using the free account, remember that your username will also be your subdomain (the first part of your public URL). So if your
username is `mycoolsite`, the URL will be `mycoolsite.pythonanywhere.com`.

* Check the terms and conditions box and choose **Register**.

You're given brief online tour of PythonAnywhere.

* Choose **End Tour** when you're done.
